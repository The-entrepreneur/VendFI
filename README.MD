5. **A simple funnel from applications to approvals and funded deals (where data allows).
6. **3–5 concrete changes you can make to your offers or flows.

## Why Vendors Love It

### **Works with Any Data Format**
Most vendors have messy data:
- Different column names ("Order ID" vs "Deal Reference" vs "Transaction")
- Multiple date formats (15/11/2024 vs 2024-11-15)
- Inconsistent statuses ("APPROVED" vs "Funded" vs "OK")

**VendFI handles it all automatically.** No data cleanup required.

### **Instant Value**
- Upload CSV → Get report in **under 30 seconds**
- No integration, no IT team, no waiting
- Works with exports from Shopify, WooCommerce, PropelPay, or any system

### **Actionable, Not Just Pretty**
Every report includes:
- **Specific recommendations** ("Make 24-month your default term")
- **Friction hotspots** (products with high interest but low approval)
- **Trend analysis** (is finance adoption improving?)
- **Benchmarks** (how you compare to peers)
